<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-justify">There is hardly anyone who may not have heard of this line but hardly anyone may know if this line holds the truth until they have gone through the journey.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It&#8217;s not an emotional post rather I&#8217;m trying to put the facts about love so that one can know the situation in which they are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Fact is, there is nothing like <em><strong>Love at first sight</strong></em> but it is <em><strong>Attraction at first sight</strong></em>. The funniest part is that we know this truth somewhere in our head but we try to suppress it because the feeling of having someone in our life is so awesome. You behave differently for that person, you try to make them feel special and if the same thing happen from the other side then it&#8217;s a <strong><em>bingo</em></strong> but what if it&#8217;s a <strong><em>big no</em></strong>&#8230;</p>



<span id="more-986"></span>



<p>Let&#8217;s divide it into 2 situations:</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>1</strong>. It&#8217;s a <strong><em>Bingo</em></strong>:<br>Other person feels the same for you and it happened in a very short span         of time and now you both have started sharing emotions, feelings and started making each other to feel special, once time passes you come to  know about bad part of each other.<br><br><strong>a</strong>.<strong> </strong><em>After knowing that if your relationship sustain then you may end up having a true love</em> <br><br><strong>b</strong>. <em>What if they don&#8217;t like your bad part or something which you like but they don&#8217;t</em> <br>This situation you may end up in having a break up and if this happens then you never been into love you were compromising to prove your decision of choosing someone by just <em><strong>looking at him/her at first sight</strong></em>.<br>It&#8217;s a very painful situation and it will give you a pain of loosing someone whom you never loved, so think twice before proposing or accepting proposal of someone whose bad side you may not know or ignoring because of your hormone.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify"><strong>2</strong>. It&#8217;s a <strong><em>Big No</em></strong><br>I call it&#8217;s a very fortunate situation where things end before even they start but still few people take this on their ego and try to put themself and other person in a very confusing and a loop situation but you need to understand that it doesn&#8217;t matter if it would have been a Yes or No because you are trying to pretend other and yourself that you love them and they love you.</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">We need to understand that love is not a boundation but it's a freedom that we provide to feel safe &amp; happy.</pre>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">Love is a magical moment, it&#8217;s a beautiful thread that tie 2 person in an environment agreed by both of them by mutual understanding over the period of time <strong><em>after having so many fights</em></strong>.<br>This may take 1 year, 2 years or 4 years depending on the frequency of both getting involve with each other.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">For that you don&#8217;t have to pre commit each other, here are the following steps which one should take to have graceful entry or exit:<br>1. Friendship is the very first step that we should always take, after that just be with them.<br>2. If you are still not having fights then you are still not comfortable with each other and showing your good face, once you get into arguments and show real you to each other then things will either move ahead or just stop but with mutual discussion, so still if you revert from this point then it won&#8217;t be that much painful because you know the logical reason.<br>2. But even after that, If you both like each other&#8217;s friendship then this relationship will slowly move to be the best friendship.<br>3. This phase could be more harder than the previous phase because here you will get into more details of each other and you may not like certain things.<br>4. Now at this point you would be very clear about their decision, either they like you as a friend or they have feelings for you.<br></p>



<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Since it&#8217;s a magical feel, so now you may not need to say I LOVE YOU anymore <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/1f642.png" alt="🙂" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> <img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/72x72/2764.png" alt="❤" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p></blockquote>

<p class="has-drop-cap has-text-align-justify">How you feel, when you give something to a person who doesn&#8217;t have it, it not just brings happiness to him but also to your heart. But the major challenge you face is whom to help. How would you make sure, that person is not lying, that organisation is not lying and hence at last you restrict yourself and limit your boundaries.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">So, I decided to write a post to let you know my perception, how I see things and help people. There are lot of people who has a very wrong perception in their mind about:</p>



<span id="more-676"></span>



<h4>Why should I help ?</h4>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">They say whatever I&#8217;ve today is whatever I&#8217;ve earned from my own hard work or my family hard work. Why should I help someone who didn&#8217;t do the hard work and now he is suffering.<br><br>The answer to this question is very deep, you need to understand whatever you have today is not just because of your hard work, it&#8217;s also because you got the opportunity to do so.<br><br>Now when you say opportunity, it&#8217;s a series of events happening since your childhood which results into a considerable situation to move ahead and do the hard work.<br><br>Now that series of events is in millions / billions / trillions and you never know who contributed where, your teacher who dedicated her time to make you understand, your driver who dropped you on time, your auto rickshaw who saved you once otherwise you won&#8217;t have exists, just like this there are uncountable help you got from others.<br><br>So, let&#8217;s help others and contribute in creating an opportunity for them to move forward in life.</p>



<h4>Whom to help ?</h4>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">You don&#8217;t trust organisation, you don&#8217;t trust people who beg. Then what should you do ?<br><br>You need to think a bit more here,  you need to analyse the person who is begging, if he / she is an old personality then why does it matter if they even lies because I can&#8217;t see my grandparents to be in such condition and then I&#8217;ll be helping them out with whatever I can.<br><br>Maids, street vegetable sellers or any other worker with small wages, please don&#8217;t bargain from them, try to give more to them. Try to ask them if you can help them with their daughter wedding or a child education or anything that make you feel happy.<br><br>If you don&#8217;t have time, then you can opt for an organisation, there are lot of organisation who provides you the proof of authenticity, you can dig deeper to check if they are valid or not. Since everything is online now so it&#8217;s a bit transparent to see whom you&#8217;ll be helping and for what reason, <a href="https://www.ketto.org/new/signin?redirect_uri=%2F%3Futm_source%3Dexternal_Ketto%26utm_medium%3Dgoogle-search%26utm_campaign%3DS14_1001_SALE_BrandVariation_KY_ALL_CLK_IND%26utm_term%3Db_%252Bketto%2520%252Bdonate%26utm_content%3Dhomepage_resp_ad1%26utm_placement%3DKT05_AG_1865_BrandSeed_Donation%26gclid%3DEAIaIQobChMI-uqMiZHa5wIVB7aWCh2ayA7yEAAYASAAEgIpZvD_BwE&amp;as=si">Ketto</a> is one of them.</p>



<p>There is one interesting question, I usually get from the people, it may seems selfish but it&#8217;s just their curiosity, they ask&#8230;</p>



<h4>What if everyone get educated then who will do the cleaning work, driving work or other small wages work ?</h4>



<p class="has-text-align-justify">It&#8217;s a very interesting question and I do have a very interesting answer to that, when people are educated they figure out the smartest way to do things. If I talk about cleaning the pit holes, today they are doing by themselves but if they educate their child, then their child can build a robot / machine to do so. In a similar way maid can be replaced, anything can be done. So it indirectly answers another question that today machines are replacing man and they are getting unemployed so if we educate them then can contribute in automating this whole world and sky is the limit.</p>

But do you really think is that what makes you happy?

Even when you fail in accomplishing them you try to think positive to live with them because you don&#8217;t trust yourself.

If you really want to know real you, you have to feel that box / cage [created by others] and you have to step out and think what you exactly want, go into your childhood and try to remember what you felt, when you saw an older woman begging for a coin, what you decided to be or how you decided to help her, or anything which strikes you to be something, bring that real you in yourself, dream it now and but do set a goal because &#8230; &nbsp;</amp-fit-text></amp-fit-text></p>
